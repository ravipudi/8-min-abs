# 8 Minute Abs for Garmin Devices

There is a video on YouTube [8 Minute Abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY) that I've followed in different periods in my life. Now that I own a Garmin Fenix 5 watch, I'm back doing these exercises I got this idea of implementing a simple application on my watch to follow along these exercises in a more easier way.

I start the app from my watch and it uses tones and vibrations to tell me when to switch to a new exercise and also lets me know of the exercise name. Once I'm done it saves this as training activity for keeping track purposes.
