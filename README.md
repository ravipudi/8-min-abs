# 8 Minute Abs for Garmin Devices

There is a video on YouTube [8 Minute Abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY) that I've followed in different periods in my life. Now that I own a Garmin Fenix 5 watch, I'm back doing these exercises I got this idea of implementing a simple application on my watch to follow along these exercises in a more easier way.

I start the app from my watch and it uses tones and vibrations to tell me when to switch to a new exercise and also lets me know of the exercise name. Once I'm done it saves this as training activity for keeping track purposes.

# Installation

The easiest installation medium is through the Garmin App Store. Navigate there with the Garmin App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile&hl=en), [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garmin-connect/id583446403?mt=8)) on your phone, [Garmin Express](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/software/express) on your computer or straight from the [Connect IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-CA/apps/dd44d9e9-d377-471e-ba3f-c75adc7a958d).

# Build from source

To build the project you need to have the [Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) installed. I'm currently building this with the `3.1.6` version of the SDK while using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) IDE with the Garmin Eclipse Plug-in. See [Getting Started](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/getting-started/) guide by Garmin for a complete setup documentation.
